# Deformation analytical models

## Summary

Some basic analytical models to compute surface deformations in elastic half-space. Most of the codes are pure Matlab/Octave vectorized language, some are written in C for optimization.

### [Mogi](mogi)
Point source in elastic half-space, approximation for sphere of radius a &lt;&lt; f to compute displacements, tilt and strain at surface [_Mogi_, 1958].

### [Sun](sun)
Penny-shaped crack in elastic half-space, approximation for h/a >> 1 to compute displacements at surface [_Sun_, 1969].

### [Okada](okada)
Rectangular dislocation in elastic half-space to compute displacements, tilt and strain at surface [_Okada_, 1985].

### [Okubo](okubo)
Rectangular dislocation in elastic half-space to compute gravity and elevation change at surface [_Okubo_, 1992]


### [Nikkhoo](nikkhoo)
Three mutually orthogonal point tensile dislocations in elastic half-space, approximation for inflated/deflated sill, dyke, pipe or any ellipsoid in the far-field [_Nikkhoo et al._, 2017]

### [Doodson](https://github.com/beaudu/doodson)
Compute Doodson tidal wave components.
