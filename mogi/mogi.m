%MOGI   Mogi's model (point source of dilatation in elastic half-space).
%   [Ur,Uz,Dt,Er,Et] = MOGI(R,F,A,P,E,nu) computes at the surface radial 
%   and vertical displacements Ur and Uz, ground tilt Dt, radial and 
%   tangential strain Er and Et at the surface, at a radial distance R from
%   the top of the source due to a hydrostatic pressure inside a sphere of 
%   radius A at depth F, in a homogeneous, semi-infinite elastic body and 
%   approximation for A << F (center of dilatation). Formula by Anderson 
%   [1936] and Mogi [1958].
%
%   MOGI(R,F,V,nu) is the point approximation of Mogi's model, with volume
%   variation V as source of dilatation potency, a solution which does not
%   depend on A, P neither E input parameters.
%
%	MOGI(R,F,A,µ,P) and MOGI(R,F,V) are also allowed for compatibility 
%	(Mogi's original equation considers an isotropic material with Lamé's 
%	constants equal, i.e., lambda = µ, Poisson's ratio = 0.25).
%
%	Input parameters:
%	   F: depth of the center of the sphere from the surface,
%	   V: volumetric change of the sphere,
%	   A: radius of the sphere,
%	   P: hydrostatic pressure change in the sphere,
%	   E: elasticity (Young's modulus),
%	  nu: Poisson's ratio,
%	   µ: rigidity (Lamé's constant in case of isotropic material).
%
%   Output parameters:
%     Ur: radial displacement (same unit as R, F and A)
%     Uz: tangential displacement (same unit as R, F and A)
%     Dt: ground tilt (in rad)
%     Er: radial strain
%     Et: tangential strain
%
%	Notes:
%		- Equations are all vectorized, so variables R,F,V,A,µ and P can 
%		  be vectors or N-D matrix of the same size and any of them can
%		  be scalars; then outputs will be also vector or matrix.
%		- Convention: Uz > 0 = UP, F is depth so in -Z direction.
%		- Units should be consistent, e.g.: R, F, A, Ur and Uz in m imply
%		  V in m3; E, µ and P in Pa; Dt in rad, Er, Et and nu dimensionless.

%	Example for a 3-D plot of exagerated deformed surface due to a 1-bar
%	overpressure in a 10-cm radius sphere at 1-m depth in rock:
%	  [x,y] = meshgrid(-3:.1:3);
%	  [th,rho] = cart2pol(x,y);
%	  [ur,uz] = mogi(rho,1,0.1,1e5,10e9,0.25);
%	  [ux,uy] = pol2cart(th,ur);
%	  ps = 1e8;
%	  surf(x+ux*ps,y+uy*ps,uz*ps), axis equal, light
